üß± Minimal / Beginner-Friendly Tetris Clone Feature List
‚úÖ 1. Core Gameplay Loop
    X   - Game area (10√ó20 grid).
    X   - Falling tetrominoes (all 7 standard types).
    X   - Gravity: piece falls one cell every N milliseconds.
    X   - Player controls:
        X   - Move left/right.
        X   - Rotate (clockwise only is fine).
        X   - Soft drop (accelerated fall).
        X   - Hard drop (instantly locks).
    X   - Locking: piece becomes part of grid after touching down.
    X   - Next piece preview (1 piece is enough).
    X   - Line clearing: full horizontal rows disappear.
    X   - Scoring: 1‚Äì4 lines cleared gives points.
    X   - Scoring: Dropping gives points per line.
    X   - Game over: triggered when new piece can't be placed.
    X   - Replay: Reset grid and tetromino states

üß∞ 2. Basic Infrastructure
    X   - Game state management (e.g., Playing, GameOver).
    X   - Fixed timestep simulation.
    X   - Grid representation (2D array of cell states).
    X   - Tetromino system:
        X   - Definition of 7 tetromino types.
        X   - Rotation handling (basic 90¬∞).
        X   - Spawning at top center of grid.

üñºÔ∏è 3. Rendering
    X   - Render game grid and locked tiles.
    X   - Render active falling piece.
    X   - Render pieces in different colors.
    X   - Render next piece preview.
    X   - Draw basic UI: score, lines cleared, FPS.

üîÑ 4. Basic Timing & Difficulty
    X   - Gravity tick every N milliseconds (e.g., 1 per second initially).
    X   - Speed up gravity over time or based on lines cleared.
    DAS (delayed auto-shift) and repeat for holding left/right (optional).

    5. Sound
    Fall
    Lock
    Can't move
    Line clear

ü™ú Stretch Features (Optional but Fun)
üéÆ Gameplay Enhancements
    Hold piece functionality.
    T-spin recognition and bonuses.
    SRS (Super Rotation System) with wall kicks.
    Level system: increase speed every 10 lines.
    Combo and back-to-back bonuses.

üß† UX & Polish
    Pause menu.
    Restart game.
    Title screen / game over screen.
    Ghost piece (shows where piece will land).
    Sound effects.
    Music loop.

üíæ Persistence
    High score saving.
    Configurable key bindings or settings.

üß© Suggested Development Order
    X   - Grid + Tetromino drawing.
    X   - Piece falling (auto and with keys).
    X   - Collision and locking.
    X   - Line clearing logic.
    X   - Piece spawning and game loop.
    X   - Score and game over detection.
    UI and polish.

 * tetromino class
 *      vector of points
 *      how to rotate?
 *      how to collide? just before moving down, check if any of the 'blocks' would hit something
 *      how to form connections? or complete lines? do they merge?
 *
 *
 * how do blocks fall down after merging together?
